## 📂 Tasks Overview

### **✅ Task 1 — Exploring and Visualizing a Simple Dataset**
**Objective:**  
Load, inspect, and visualize the **Iris Dataset** to understand feature trends, distributions, and relationships.

**Steps Completed:**  
- Loaded dataset using **pandas** and **seaborn**.  
- Displayed shape, column names, and first few rows.  
- Generated dataset summary using `.info()` and `.describe()`.  
- Created:
  - **Scatter plot** (pairwise feature relationships)
  - **Histograms** (value distribution per feature)
  - **Box plots** (outlier detection)
  
**Skills Used:** Data loading, summary statistics, matplotlib & seaborn visualizations.

### **✅ Task 2 — Predict Future Stock Prices (Short-Term)**
**Objective:**  
Use historical stock data to predict the **next day's closing price**.

**Steps Completed:**  
- Retrieved stock data from **Yahoo Finance** using `yfinance` (selected stock: e.g., Tesla).  
- Used **Open**, **High**, **Low**, and **Volume** as features to predict the **Close** price.  
- Trained a **Linear Regression** model.  
- Visualized **Actual vs Predicted** closing prices.

**Skills Used:** Time series data handling, regression modeling, API data fetching, matplotlib plotting.

### **✅ Task 3 — Heart Disease Prediction**
**Objective:**  
Predict whether a person is at risk of **heart disease** using the **UCI Heart Disease Dataset**.

**Steps Completed:**  
- Loaded and cleaned dataset (handled missing values).  
- Performed **EDA** to analyze trends and distributions.  
- Trained a **Logistic Regression** model for binary classification.  
- Evaluated model using:
  - **Accuracy score**
  - **ROC curve**
  - **Confusion matrix**  
- Highlighted **important features** impacting predictions.

**Skills Used:** Binary classification, feature importance analysis, ROC-AUC evaluation.
